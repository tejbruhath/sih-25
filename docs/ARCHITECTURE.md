# System Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the system architecture, design decisions, and technical specifications for the SIH project.

## Architecture Decisions Log (ADL)

### ADL-001: Documentation-First Approach
- **Date**: 2025-09-01
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Large project requiring careful tracking and change management
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive markdown-based documentation system
