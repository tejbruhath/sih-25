# Development Notes

## Key Insights & Learnings

### Project Setup (2025-09-01)
- Established documentation-first approach for large project management
- Created modular directory structure for scalability
- Implemented systematic change tracking with CHANGELOG.md
- Set up progress monitoring system for visibility

## Technical Decisions

### Documentation Strategy
- **Markdown-based**: Easy to version control, readable, and widely supported
- **Structured approach**: Separate files for different concerns (progress, changes, architecture, requirements)
- **Living documents**: Designed to evolve with the project

### Project Organization
- **Clear separation**: Distinct directories for source, tests, config, scripts, and docs
- **Scalable structure**: Can accommodate growth without major restructuring
- **Navigation-friendly**: README.md serves as central hub with quick links

## Best Practices Established

1. **Change Tracking**: Every significant change documented in CHANGELOG.md
2. **Progress Monitoring**: Daily/weekly updates in PROGRESS.md
3. **Architecture Documentation**: Decision log format for tracking rationale
4. **Requirements Management**: Structured template for comprehensive specification

## Future Considerations

### Reindexing Strategy
- Monitor file growth and complexity
- Consider automated documentation generation for large codebases
- Implement cross-referencing system for related documents

### Scaling Documentation
- Template creation for consistent documentation patterns
- Automated changelog generation from commit messages
- Integration with development workflow

## Action Items
- [ ] Define specific project requirements
- [ ] Choose technology stack
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create coding standards document
- [ ] Establish testing strategy
